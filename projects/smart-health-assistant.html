                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The Smart Health Assistant is an AI-powered system designed to support users in managing their health by monitoring health data, providing personalized medical insights, symptom checking, and offering healthcare decision support to improve well-being and care outcomes.</p>

            <div class="project-problem">
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Many individuals face challenges managing personal health data and accessing timely medical advice, leading to delayed care or poor health decisions. This project addresses these issues by providing an intelligent assistant that delivers real-time health monitoring and personalized guidance, empowering users to take proactive control of their health.</p>

            <div class="project-approach">
                <h2>Methodology & Approach</h2>
                <p>The project started by collecting and integrating diverse health data sources such as wearable devices and user inputs. Data preprocessing ensured accuracy and consistency. Machine learning models with natural language processing capabilities were developed to interpret symptoms and health indicators. The assistant was then deployed with real-time interaction features, continuously refined through user feedback and performance monitoring.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection/Preparation:</strong> Health data was sourced from wearable devices, user surveys, and medical datasets, then cleaned and standardized to maintain reliability and privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> New features like risk scores, trend analyses, and symptom severity indexes were created by analyzing raw health metrics and user inputs to improve the assistant’s predictive accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> We chose transformer-based NLP models and supervised learning classifiers for symptom interpretation and personalized recommendations due to their strong contextual understanding and accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training & Evaluation:</strong> Models were trained on labeled medical data and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure trustworthy health assessments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch were used for model development; spaCy and NLTK handled natural language processing; Flask was used for backend API deployment; and AWS provided scalable hosting.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="technical-deep-dive">
                <h2>Technical Deep Dive</h2>
                <p>A core component of the Smart Health Assistant is the use of transformer-based attention mechanisms for symptom understanding. This allows the model to capture nuanced context from user inputs, enabling accurate interpretation of complex or ambiguous health queries. For example, the assistant can distinguish between similar symptoms with different causes by analyzing sentence structure and keywords, enhancing the quality of medical advice it provides.</p>
                <pre><code>
// Example Python snippet for symptom interpretation using transformers

from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=5)

def predict_symptom_category(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    probs = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probs).item()
    return predicted_class
